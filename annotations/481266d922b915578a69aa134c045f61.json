This gesture occasioned some controversy at the time, and its meaning is still debated by modern historians. There is something of a tradition of interpreting the decision in relation to Richard's marriages, given the timing of the gesture. Edward the Confessor was believed to have had a celibate marriage with Edith of Wessex (this is unlikely to have been true historically), leading some scholars to argue that Richard II and Anne of Bohemia emulated this choice, particularly given that Anne had had saintly Bohemian ancestors who had taken up celibacy after giving birth to heirs. This seems implausible on the face of it, and is disproven by a letter written by Anne to her half-brother Wenceslaus IV, King of Bohemia, in the 1380s, in which she implies she has recently had a miscarriage, but writes of her optimism that she will eventually achieve a successful pregnancy. However, Richard did contract a celibate marriage&ndash;namely, his second marriage, to the seven-year-old Isabelle de Valois, as part of an important peace alliance with France, committing him to many years of marriage in name only (which may well have been welcome to him, as he had grieved very deeply for Anne, who had died in 1394). The use of Edward the Confessor's arms therefore allowed Richard to express his allegiance to an English royal saintly tradition and also the manly self-control implied by a commitment to celibacy.
